# Arrays

## Core concepts

- Indexing, in-place modifications, contiguous memory.

- Prefix sums, suffix sums.

- Sorting vs scanning.

## Common patterns

- Two-pointer, swapping in-place, frequency/histogram via map/array.

- Sliding window for subarray sums/lengths.

- Partitioning (Dutch national flag).

## Typical pitfalls

- Off-by-one errors in pointers.

- Mutating while iterating.

- Integer overflow for sums.

## Big-O cheatsheet

- Scan: O(n)

- Sort: O(n log n)

- Hash lookup: O(1) avg
