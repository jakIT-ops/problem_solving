# 1. Full LeetCode Mastery Roadmap

## Stages

### Beginner (Foundation)

- **Focus:** core data structures, simple algorithms and patterns.
- **Skills:** arrays, strings, hash maps, pointers, two-pointers, basic recursion, sorting, basic bit ops.
- **Patterns:** sliding window (easy), prefix/suffix sums, basic hashing, simple BFS/DFS (trees).
- **Problems to solve:** **~150** (mix: 80 easy, 50 medium, 20 hard)
  - Why: volume + variety builds intuition, reduces fear of trick variants.

### Intermediate (Consolidation)

- **Focus:** standard algorithmic problems and problem composition.
- **Skills:** heaps, BSTs, two-way pointers, DFS/BFS on graphs, recursion + memo, dynamic programming basics, binary search, union-find.
- **Patterns:** topological sort, cycles detection, DP (1D/2D), backtracking basics.
- **Problems to solve:** **~300** (120 medium, 120 easy, 60 hard)
  - Why: breadth+depth to connect patterns and start optimizing.

### Advanced (Optimization & Design)

- **Focus:** complex DP, graph path algorithms, advanced greedy, amortized analysis, advanced data structures (segment tree, BIT), design problems.
- **Skills:** advanced DP states, segment tree, fenwick tree, heavy-light, rolling hash, tries, suffix arrays (basics), concurrency patterns (conceptual).
- **Patterns:** DP on trees, meet-in-the-middle, divide & conquer optimization, shortest path variants (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford).
- **Problems to solve:** **~400** (mixed: 200 medium, 150 hard, 50 expert)
  - Why: prepares you for high-difficulty interview & contest problems.

### Expert (Competitive / Research)

- **Focus:** cutting-edge techniques, contest pacing, proofs and correctness.
- **Skills:** advanced graph theory, number theory, combinatorics, state compression DP, randomized algorithms, complexity lower bounds.
- **Problems to solve:** **ongoing** — participate in contests and solve 100+ very hard / contest problems.
  - Why: maintain and grow peak problem-solving skill.
